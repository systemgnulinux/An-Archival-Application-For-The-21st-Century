Society has reached a critical point in the information age in which media manipulation, censorship, bloggers, fake news, information warfare, political pundits, cookies, journalists, conspiracy theory’s, spam bots, advertisment disinfomation, and giant social media applications are all vying for your attention, your beliefs and your votes.

The challenge is to find new alternative means of engaging with our information, our vast historical knowledge and find new solutions that are factual, concise and educational with our long and short termed preserved archives in a plural and egalitarian way.

There is a unique opportunity to build a true privacy preserving utilitarian application that hosts the full archival record of all current and past elective representatives votes on all major issues going back as far early 20th century. It is imperative that it is built with FOSS principles and GPL license to retain it’s independence. Entirely politician and party agnostic, regardless of unsavory elements and free from favoritism, partisin, censorship and protected from external influence, allowing each and everyone the capacity to navigate and reflect in privacy. The application should be designed to have the strongest defensive measures against neighbouring app data extraction, screencapture, malware, keyboard logging, virus, screen recording and internal operating system telemetry.

The design should aim for user friendly simplicity, clear intuitive navigation with drop down search selection options on topics of interest. Output should provide a selection of politicians who meet the search criteria and each politicians profile should provide basic details such as, age, party affiliation, voting record and a short biography. The veracity of all facts must be externally auditable by anyone and all editorial decisions must be done with extreme care.

In conclusion the application should be a safe place to adventure out of
ones comfort zone and explore their own decision making when faced with the many varied possibilities presented beside the usual two, three party systems. Users can generate a random user name and password and delete profile on closing, returning the applications original state, thus encouraging themselves to venture outside old ossified patterns and allow oneself to imagine new realities. Above all it should encourage selfhood, self-advocacy and psychological liberatis.

So Cyberpunks arise now and go now and write code that strengthens the
foundations of democracy.
